### Food Wastage Solutions Application

This application is intended to help reduce foods wasted due to lack of preservatives means like refrigerated stores where local vendors can keep their excess produces not bought on a market day. 

In villages where there are no good road networks or electricity supply; horticultural farmers, fishermen and abattoir folks do end up  disposing large chunk of their excess meat, fish or vegetables. In some instances, some would sell at a lost because they cannot keep their produce intact for certain number of days. While other do give away to. All these make vendors incur great loses. 

Thus, **Food Wastage Solutions Application** is designed to mitigate the rate at which farmer loose large of their produce been it fish, meat or vegetables. This application allows farmers -vendors create an account and be able to upload pictures of their excess produces, set prices, contact (phone/email) and choose location where potential buyers (middlemen) would pick them up when they commit to buy. Equally, middlemen who have refrigerated trucks/tractor-trailers and live in cities can have an account and be able to see the posts of the items posted by the vendors. Should they have interest in buying, they can add to their cards and the vendor would instantly get a notification that someone has interest in buying their produce. Then, from there either side can reach out to the other.
